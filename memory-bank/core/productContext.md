# Product Context - LearnGerman

## Problem Statement
Learning German grammar requires constant reference to conjugation tables, case rules, and preposition lists. Existing resources are either too complex (textbooks) or too fragmented (random websites). Learners need a single, well-organized, always-available reference tool.

## Solution
A lightweight, fast-loading web app that serves as the ultimate German grammar cheat sheet with optional practice modes.

## User Experience Goals
- **Instant access**: No login, no setup, just open and learn
- **Visual clarity**: Clean tables with color-coding for cases and genders
- **Search**: Quick search across all content
- **Practice**: Optional quiz mode to test knowledge
- **Mobile-first**: Works perfectly on phones during commute or study sessions

## Design Principles
1. **Simplicity over features**: Every screen should serve one clear purpose
2. **Visual hierarchy**: Important patterns should be immediately visible
3. **Color-coded grammar**: Masculine (blue), Feminine (red), Neuter (green), Plural (yellow)
4. **Progressive disclosure**: Show overview first, details on demand
